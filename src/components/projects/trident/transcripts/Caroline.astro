<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> Interesting, it thinks we're near Illegal Pete's. Um, so if, uh, if you want to give your name, you don't have to. Um, and like when you started at Trident generally? </p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Caroline:</strong> Yeah, um, I'm Caroline. I started at Trident a few years ago, I think back in 2020, and then worked there up until Spring of 2023. So I was there for three-ish years.</p>
<p>A little more, a little less I think. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> Cool. And what, um, why did you like, choose to start working there? </p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Caroline:</strong> Um, it was pandemic ish era. Uh, 2020 was definitely covid. But we started being able to open things back up and I had lost my job going into the pandemic. So I was looking for something that I could do that would get me out of the house because I was getting stir crazy like I think literally everyone was and I love books and I like the vibe in Trident.</p>
<p>It was a really small, old indie bookstore with a cafe, and I figured if I was working somewhere where I could have books and coffee, then my life wouldn't be too bad. No matter what it turned out to be. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> Sounds about right. How was, like, the onboarding process? Did you have, like, previous, like, were you a barista before so you knew how to, like, work the espresso machine?</p>
<p>Or, like, have you worked in a bookstore before? Um, </p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Caroline:</strong> I, yeah, I have had, I had some bookstore experience going in, and I had some, It's a food service experience, but nothing that was specifically cafe related. Um, and when you start at Trident, everybody starts on dish. And um, the hiring process is a little bit Who can annoy Peter the most?</p>
<p>So Basically I went in, dropped off a resume, and Peter said we don't have space now, but we might in a couple weeks, because it was a school year switch, so people were shuffling around, and he's like, if you want to work here, just come in and keep coming in and keep asking. And I was like, okay, I will continue to be here.</p>
<p>I will be here every few days and I will annoy you until I get a </p>
<p>job. Um, </p>
<p>So, the um, Getting a job there was a little chaotic and then onboarding was basically I showed up one day and went through most of a shift with someone who had been working there for a while. Learn things. And then that was, that was pretty much, that was it.</p>
<p>That was the training. That was the onboarding, shadowing somebody else, shadowing someone else. Basically. It's not, it's not a complex job, but it's not an easy job. I think anyone in food service will tell you it's not, it's not hard in that it's difficult to learn, but it's just extremely taxing. So I was basically walked through what we do and then I did it for that Shift under supervision and alternating between that and then shadowing and then basically was on my own, um, with a little bit of guidance for, uh, for maybe like three shifts after that, just by like the managers kind of helping me like, remind me, don't forget this is a task.</p>
<p>This exists, and stuff the </p>
<p>existing stuff. </p>
<p>Okay. So there wasn't much onboarding. It was pretty much just, end of the fire, you go. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And that makes sense. Um, So, how was How is, like, other stuff, aside from, like, you know, you're here and here's a task to do, like, how is, like, kind of the surrounding, um, like, anything about Trident communicated, like, um, did they, like, tell you about the history at all?</p>
<p>Did they tell you about, like, how things were structured at all? Like, what was, </p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Caroline:</strong> um Kind of, so day one I got there, um, Peter did kind of go through a quick spiel, um, saying like we are employee owned, so we don't have like one person making all the decisions. Um. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> Did you know that before you applied, or like was that the first time you were hearing about it?</p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Caroline:</strong> I think I found out about that, like, while I was applying. Like, when I kind of took my resume and I talked to Peter that first time. Um, kind of a mini interview, I guess. Um, but yeah, kind of didn't totally understand how they ran things until a little later. Um, they use Slack to communicate and then they have owner meetings once a month.</p>
<p>And that's when, like, votes. They hold votes and they make decisions and stuff. Um, I was never an owner, so I didn't go to those. I wasn't privy to those discussions. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> Were you able to attend and just not vote? Couldn't go at all? Did you have any idea, like, what they were voting on? Or like, what? Anything that was discussed?</p>
<p>Did you hear about that afterward? </p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Caroline:</strong> Not really, unless there was a change that was being made to something that was happening, like, on the floor. So, like, if we changed kombucha vendors, like, there'd be like, heads up, we voted, we're changing, this is what's going on, this is the new, like, Because the kombucha we used was on tap, so it was a keg that you hooked up to.</p>
<p>So, they're like, when you go down there, to hook up the new keg, this is what it's going to look like. And we were like, okay, cool, great. Um, stuff like that. But we, and we actually had, started having like employee meetings, kind of. And we were like, is there any way that we could find out what is being discussed? Discussed in these owner meetings, um, what's being voted on, like, we don't need to know the fine details, but is there any way we can know, as people who might not have the means to buy into ownership, can we know what's going on in our own workplace?</p>
<p>And they basically said, no, because it's a liability thing. Like with business decisions. Um, so I have no idea what that meant because I wasn't part of any of those conversations. Um, but we started getting notes that at least outlined, after every owner's meeting, stuff that would affect us day to day.</p>
<p>Which, we started getting something, um, but we still weren't allowed to know what was being discussed in a, like, super candid fashion. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> Yeah. Yeah, like, because I could understand, like, not voting on things because you're, you haven't bought into the ownership structure, but, um, just like, being able, like, I would think you'd be able to attend.</p>
<p>I, I don't see the problem with that personally, but, um, so I'd be curious what liability might be in that, in that context. Um, um, when you said employee meeting, was that just the employees that weren't owners, or everybody?</p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Caroline:</strong> It was an everyone situation. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> Are those a regular thing? </p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Caroline:</strong> I think we tried to make them regular. Where we would say, like, we're going to have a meeting with Peter.</p>
<p>On this day at this time, come if you want to. If there's anything you want to discuss. If you have any questions. Um, but we had consistently extremely low attendance to those. Um, it was usually me and like two people. And Peter. And um, the first one there was a ton of attendance. And then after that it was usually only like two or three people.</p>
<p>And um, so those kind of phased themselves out. Um,</p>
<p>so it was like, we tried to make them regular, like a once a month thing, but it just, it never stuck. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> Never really materialized, </p>
<p>yeah. And so, let's see, so you worked there for around three years. Yeah. Um, was there, I don't know, like anything like ebb and flow over that time of like, um, you know, when you started?</p>
<p>Started, everything was going great and then in the middle, like it wasn't, or like what is, um, I don't know. Kind of tell, walk me through that. Like trajectory, I guess. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Caroline:</strong> So </p>
<p>the culture of Trident is very, um. very cliquey, if that makes sense. So, from when I first started, um, I was racing road bikes, and Peter thought that was super cool because he was a former athlete, and I think was a pro climber at one point, and whatever.</p>
<p>So, um, I was treated extremely well. If I came in from a training ride and was wiped, I was, you know, that was kind of fine. Um, after I stopped Racing that kind of switched over to someone who came in who was then like really focusing a lot on her climbing. Mm-Hmm. . So there was definitely, um, a little bit of, I don't wanna say favoritism because we were, we all like, were treated the same and like a Mm-Hmm.</p>
<p>from a professional standpoint saying professional when it's a cafe, it's kind of weird, but yeah. </p>
<p>I was </p>
<p>at professional level. Um, like that definitely happened. Um, there were people who had been working there for a really long time who were really tight knit. And, um, I don't know how to explain it. It was like, very, it felt very high school.</p>
<p>Like, they were the popular kids and you were like, the dorky freshmen that, you know, no one asked for. Um, and I actually liked what everyone just kind of put up with. Um, so it kind of, it went from, oh you're new and we're going to help you and you're doing great to, right, you're new but not new enough and you're just kind of not in with the people who have been here forever, but you're not new enough to like, get this special like, you're new treatment.</p>
<p>Yeah. And then, um, two or, a year before I left. Um, we had a little bit of change in managerial structure. Where we got a new bookstore manager. And at that point I was working primarily bookstore shifts. I had moved from dish into the bookstore. And from there, I had moved into the bookstore. And we were getting this new bookstore manager.</p>
<p>And, um, We had, If they didn't have any, like, bookstore management experience, which is, can be fine, you know, if someone, like, is in and is willing to learn, um, then sometimes that's really cool because then they can, they don't have any previous, like, well I do this stuff. Right, right. It's really nice because, like, this is how the culture exists, so I can find a way to manage it.</p>
<p>Yeah. Um, but, it was, from the beginning, a very, um, micromanaging situation where, um, Um, and I felt this and to a lot of, some of the other people who were part of that like old guard who have been around forever. Mm-Hmm. . It was like, they were like, basically I was wrong and it was whatever, but, um, </p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> so they, they felt like it was fine.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Caroline:</strong> They felt like he was fine because. Usually those people on the cafe side, so they weren't being directly managed by this person. Um, I felt constantly very, like, belittled and talked down to. Um, so I eventually was just like, hey, can you treat me with the amount of respect that someone would expect in an adult, professional setting? Um, and that was extremely upsetting to this person. And, um, it created a lot of tension there and I continued to work. Um, but then last, this past summer, I went on a trip and said, I'll be back on this date. I can come back to work on this date. When I came back, um, it turned out that I had been basically ousted, um mm-hmm.</p>
<p>over a Slack discussion that only the owners were privy to. Um, and it was, um, because he felt I was unmanageable. And it's super funny, because no one else thought that. Most of the people in that owner's chat, apparently from what I've heard, although I've heard as many stories as people I talked to, because either everyone has a different view or everyone wants to put their own spin on it, whatever.</p>
<p>That's how this sort of stuff works. Um, they Most people wanted me to stay, so it was just Very, very odd.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I eventually, so at that point I left and I haven't really been back since then. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> Most people wanted you to stay as in like the majority of the owners? </p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Caroline:</strong> Yeah, but it was a couple of people Um, who thought that the bookstore manager should have a say in who he's managing. Um, so basically, if he doesn't like someone, he should be able to get rid of them because he's in charge.</p>
<p>Which is, to me, counterintuitive to the whole Trident structure and culture where everyone's supposed to have a say. He is a manager, but there's There's a bookstore manager, a cafe manager, and then the general manager. Just Peter. Yeah. Um, and Peter said that like his hands were tied, he couldn't do anything.</p>
<p>Yeah. About me being kind of forced out and, um, the, a lot of the, there were. There were people in the group of owners Who also felt that Tom Was trying to</p>
<p>Kind of be a little bit Bigger than necessary Um, and Take more control Yeah, and so we were like, how about A couple of the owners were like, let's try to run Trident more by Committee So that, you know, there's like A little, it's not quite as broad, but quite as narrow, but I don't know. I don't know if that's stuck, because I'm not around.</p>
<p>Um, but it was, when you first start at Trident, it's very much, you feel like, yeah, everyone's kind of on equal footing. Yeah, it's clique-y, because that's, What happens sometimes. Um, and a lot of the people working there were like high schoolers or new undergrad kids, so it wasn't too far removed from that. So like I get that not a big deal.</p>
<p>Um, but it definitely starts out as even footing. And then as you get farther into it, you realize that it is far from even. And there's a huge power dynamic that if you are not an owner, um. You, you, one, you don't have any say, which I get that, because we're not an owner. Um, but, it's definitely, it creates a really weird dynamic of like first class and second class citizens within the structure.</p>
<p>It's not like, yeah, we have management and then we have employees. It's like, we have employees. But we have some employees that are better than others. Um, regardless of whether or not they're good at their job. Um, like I wasn't an owner, so I could get fired even though I was very good at my job. And there was someone who is an owner who was terrible at their job.</p>
<p>Who they couldn't really get fired because they were an owner. So, they were just kind of removed from the schedule temporarily. I don't know if they ended up going back or not. Thanks. It creates a really weird, like, foundation. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> Yeah, and could you compare that to like, if you were working at Starbucks? Or, or even like Ozo or something like that?</p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Caroline:</strong> Yeah, so, um, I worked at, I worked at another bookstore at one point, and um, We had, because it was, A corporate type of deal. Um, we had our general manager and then we had like shift managers who were key holders, um, who were not quite big managers, but they weren't regular employees. Kind of in that middle right to kind of help manage what's going on on floor as well. Um, and then there was everybody else who just kind of did their job. And it was, um, it was very, very clear. Um, not only like who was in charge or who had more power, but who you would go to, um, if something was going on. Something as little as like, Oh, this drawer on this particular register is stuck, like, can you help me figure out how to get it unstuck?</p>
<p>Or, you know, I have a customer that's not taking my answer for an answer, like, can you help? Um, typical retail things. Um, which is a lot different than At a place like Trident, where it's like, okay, yeah, you can talk to the manager, but the manager might not be available at that moment, because there's only sometimes one on premises.</p>
<p>Um, or, you know, they, they might not know, so you'd be like, oh, talk to this person, who's not a manager, he's just an employee. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> But they, they're the ones who happen to have the answer for you. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Caroline:</strong> Right, and I mean, that's When it's something like, I worked at this bookstore and I happened to know about, like, the e readers that we sold, I knew that the battery, if the battery went dead, and I mean like dead dead, not like needs to be charged up, if it crapped out, um, you'd have to, call corporate and they would replace it.</p>
<p>Um, especially if it was within a certain warranty period. I don't remember now, it's been a while, but I knew the answer. I knew the answer, and I was like, and someone who was a newer employee, the managers were busy, came up to me, because they knew I had been there for a while, and said, hey, do you know anything about this?</p>
<p>And I said, yes, it's this, this, and this. She said, are you sure? And I said, yep, I'm absolutely sure, but if you want to double check, go to this person. And she said Cool!, and that was that. And it wasn't like a, it was super chill. And it's just kind of like how</p>
<p>people got to those higher positions by, Working for the company and being promoted, versus, um, having the means to buy in and therefore be given power because they have the money, if that makes sense. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> Yeah, yeah, interesting. So yeah, like, at a, what you're saying is at a more corporate spot, just by being better at your job, you're gonna get promoted, versus Being able to buy your way in.</p>
<p>That's a perspective that I hadn't, uh, I mean, I'm not privy to, just by not being in that situation, so that's, um. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Caroline:</strong> It's definitely, definitely odd. They go, employee owned, that means the employees have a better time. It's like, mm, some of the employees. Yeah, </p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> um, okay, so, so would you say that the, like, In that more corporate example, the skill level and expertise, like, plays more of a part in those, um, In like those promotions and like, kind of who's working where and whatnot, like, and it's more merit based?</p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Caroline:</strong> Kind of. And I knew, like, every system's gonna have its pros and cons, right? Like, try to, yeah, there's a more direct line of communication from who is working on the floor to who's making the decisions. Um, that line's a little more direct. But in a more corporate setting It comes down to hours worked and reliability, like, are you showing up on time?</p>
<p>Do you, like, are you good at your job? Can you solve problems? Um, without needing the manager to solve everything for you. Um, which, in retail, it sometimes is very easy and kind of nice and comfy to just go, I don't know, talk to my manager. Right, right. I've been both people. The one who goes, I don't know, ask someone else.</p>
<p>And the person who gets good at solving things. Um, You kind of just have to get okay with people not liking you. But, anyway.</p>
<p>Working for this specific bookstore, it didn't matter if I came in one day and said, Here's 2,000 dollars, if I give this to you, can I have more of a say in how we run things around here? They'd be like, that's not how that works. Like, that's a different thing where you buy stock in a company that's not, you know.</p>
<p>But you don't, that's not how, that's not how that works. Yeah. Um, so they're like, if you want more of a say, then you keep going to work. And then eventually when a manager position opens up, you apply for it. Mm-Hmm. . And if you get it, great, and if you don't then that sucks. Maybe try again in seven years. I don't know.</p>
<p>Um, so like it, everything, like no matter what the structure is, which.</p>
<p>The systems have their pros and cons. Like, that corporate system is really messed up and I don't, I don't like it at all. But then Trident also has its messed up ness. There's, I don't think there is a perfect system, necessarily. Like, I can tell you horror stories about the corporate kind of bookstore I worked at.</p>
<p>And I can tell you really wonderful things about it. And I can tell you really horrible things about Trident. And I can also tell you really wonderful things about Trident. Um, I think, I think having like something that's a little like small business versus corporate is like where the huge difference is.</p>
<p>Like there's a lot more of a sense of community when you're working at something that's like an indie bookstore versus a corporate bookstore. Or a locally owned coffee shop versus like a Starbucks. Because it's just this, you, you know that the people who come into that building everyday are your community.</p>
<p>You know who's in charge of what. Or like, who's responsible for what, I guess. Versus in those corporate settings, the majority of the company you work for, you don't see everyday. So</p>
<p>Trident, that makes the community really tight knit, which can make things really fun, like holiday parties, and just like cookouts, because why not, and um, closing shifts where we blast music and clean up and, you know, we're sweaty and exhausted but we're still screaming and singing at the top of our lungs, like, that stuff doesn't happen as much in other settings.</p>
<p>Um, but that can also cause like, That can be kind of a source of the drama, right? Where you're like, well this person did this, and this person did this, and this person did this. And, um, you know who all those people are, and it kind of creates that tension. Same as like, going to a small school, or whatever.</p>
<p>Um, the community's really tight, and really fun, and really supportive. But, when something in that really tight, supportive community breaks, it can feel like everything's coming out from underneath of you.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> So, you said that you wouldn't have a, you don't have a perfect system that solves all of these problems. Um, is there like, kind of, small things that you might change, or like, if you were, let's say you had a bookstore, a coffee shop, both, how would you set it up so that, in order to have sort of the best of both worlds, or like, the kind of ideal? And how would you measure that?</p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Caroline:</strong> Yeah, and I, And that's something that's, And that's kind of, That's the thing, right? We're all like, Everything sucks. And then you say like, Okay, so what would you do? And then you go, I don't know. I don't know. Um, But, like, I, I would love to be, like, an owner of a, like, cafe bookstore. Like, that just sounds like such a nice, cozy life.</p>
<p>Um, I know that there's a lot of very stressful things that go on behind the scenes. It's not the beautiful Pinterest aesthetic life people like to think it is. But, um, the</p>
<p>I think almost running it</p>
<p>I don't know, I think the committee kind of idea is a good idea. Where instead of having like a manager and employees, you have people who work there and, and this would only work on something that's a very small business, right? But like I'm like, okay, this person is in charge of A, B, C. This person's in charge of X, Y, Z, and then this person's in charge of the couple of things in between.</p>
<p>And then when things come up, we have to like, you have to find a way to take initiative or communicate what needs to be done, those sorts of things. But I think if there's,</p>
<p>I think putting a paywall between someone who's working really hard and being able to have a say in where they spend like 40 hours of their week. Mm-Hmm. . Um, I think that's, that can be kind of an issue. Um, especially if it's a paywall that's. You know, months of your salary. Yeah. Um, like, there's, most people who are working jobs like that, like food service jobs, those jobs don't pay enough for someone to be able to just be like, ah, I don't need a paycheck this month.</p>
<p>Um, it can be very prohibitive. So if there's a, If there's a, If there's a way to Run something that's more like an actual democracy? Um, where everyone kind of has an equal say? Um, it doesn't, it's not a say based on Pay, or maybe if it was a say based on merit, where it's like, okay, you're working this many hours.</p>
<p>If it was like a bigger company, like, you know, mm-hmm. You're, you're full time, your 40 hours a week, you're working 24 hours a week. Like maybe you get like two votes and you get one or something where everyone can have a say. It's not just you have a say, you don't. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> So more of a spectrum to that? </p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Caroline:</strong> Yeah, I think more of a spectrum.</p>
<p>Um, also just some sort of way, and this would totally depend on the business itself, and, um, the culture of the people working there and that sort of thing, but, um, Somehow finding a way to encourage being good at your job, but not like encouraging the, I'm, Above you type of feeling over employees that should be kind of rankless and working together.</p>
<p>Because if you're kind of butting heads and having all this tension, it doesn't make it really easy to work together and help things run efficiently. When you're mad at whoever closed when you come to open, so you leave a mess for them when they come in for their closing shift that night as well.</p>
<p>Like eventually that's just gonna spiral. Yeah. Um, so I think that just becomes why manager jobs are so hard. 'cause you gotta manage human beings, which are the most. Fickle things, I've heard. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> Yeah, totally. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Caroline:</strong> Yeah, so I think maybe merit based, more spectrum, versus just a black and white day and night situation.</p>
<p>Um, but, then again, I've only been a, like, manager of a small bookstore for like part time. I've never, like, run a full business. So, I'm kind of talking out of my ass. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> Well, no, I mean, I appreciate your, your expertise. I think that's all the time we have. So thank you. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Caroline:</strong> Yeah.</p>
