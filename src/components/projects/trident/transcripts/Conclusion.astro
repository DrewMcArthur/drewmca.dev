  Thank you for your attention, and I hope youâ€™ve enjoyed this audio experience.

  I hope that you come away from it with an appreciation for the effort these
  people put in to run a business in a way that exemplifies Right Livelihood,
  and an appreciation for the work that still must be done to enable a shared
  and collective future, on Pearl street and beyond.

  a pilot for this project in the sections that follow.
