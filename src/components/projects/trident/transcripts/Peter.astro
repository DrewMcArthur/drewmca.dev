<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> If you wanted to start with, like, the history of Trident, just a little bit, and then, like, kind of your involvement, or, like, how long you've been around, I'd assume for a while, but... </p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Peter:</strong> Uh, okay. Well, my name is Peter Jones. I'm the general manager of Trident Booksellers and Cafe. Uh, I'm also one of the owners.</p>
<p>Let's see, uh, Trident, uh, opened in 1980. Uh, it opened originally as a bookstore and then a year later expanded and, uh, became a coffee shop as well. It was started by three gentlemen, uh, Hudson Shotwell, James Gimian, and one other guy that I don't remember his name. Um, but basically they were, uh, students of, uh, Ch√∂gyam Trungpa, uh, one of the first Tibetan Buddhist Rinpoches.</p>
<p>Maybe the first to come to the West, uh, and bring Tibetan Buddhism here. Um, and he, he had his, some of his first, uh, seminars here in Boulder. Um, you know, he also founded Naropa University, and Shambhala, and a bunch of, a bunch of other stuff. But, uh, He told all his students or whatever that they couldn't just, like, follow him around and, and kind of do basic guru worship, that they had to still, you know, do something productive in the world and, um, they called it at the time, uh, Right Livelihood.</p>
<p>Which basically just meant, you know, you, you have to... Capitalism is maybe bad, but there's ways to do capitalism that are good and that don't put negative karma into the world. Um, so, uh, Gimian and, uh, Shotwell, um, they were working originally in California for book companies and then, um, they, uh, came on board as the first employees of Shambhala Publications, which was, uh, which, uh, started in the back here.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> Oh, really? </p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Peter:</strong> Um, and that was an offshoot of Trungpa, and so when this space became for lease, they thought it was a perfect place to open up a bookstore, uh, because they figured that was, uh, right livelihood, it's something good. You know, uh, knowledge and intellectualism and conversation is always good. So, um, that's kind of how they try to start it.</p>
<p>Um, and then shortly after, I don't know the exact timeline, but maybe,.</p>
<p>83 or 84. One of the gentlemen, they sort of one of the gentlemen moved to Boston. And then another gentleman moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where Chogyam Trungpa moved his his Uh, I can't remember the name of it now. Um, His, his community of, you know, students and stuff. Um, and so they each agreed to keep doing the same idea.</p>
<p>Bookstore, coffee shop, they agreed to share the name, the concept. Some of the, uh, same logo, iconography. Um, but other than that we aren't, we weren't related. Um, and so that's how the other two... Hm, got started. Um, </p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> and is there like a, uh, like legal connection as far as like some parent you just, you just happen to have the same name </p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Peter:</strong> Yeah. They agreed, they agreed to use the same name and the same concept and everything. Um. Copyright infringement wasn't a big deal back then. Trademark status wasn't a big deal. Right. And they require one of you like Yeah, they're different states, so internet commerce wasn't happening, so there was no conflict of interest.</p>
<p>Right. Uh, so they all agreed. Um, and if you look at the Boston logo, we still use a, a version on our bookmarks. That's the original version that Boston then modified. Hmm. For the Trident symbol. We also use, uh, this one. Also, this one, uh, Trungpa painted for us. Um, and it means, it's a symbol for mountain in Chinese, South Korean, Taiwan, and Japan.</p>
<p>And, uh, we're at the foot of the mountains, right? And then also at the same time it's, uh, The, I believe it's this, uh, the head of the sword of Vajra, which in Tibetan Buddhism cuts through the three imperfections. I can't remember them all. One is one is falsehood. One is ego. And one is something else. So a lot of kind of hidden meanings in the logos.</p>
<p>So anyways, that's the founding of Trident. Um, so it's always been owned by a group. Uh, the group's changed over time. Um, you know, let's see. Uh, Mike Smith, the former manager. Uh, I think he, he was the first employee of Trident. And then he bought in when he became manager. And he was here until...</p>
<p>2014, maybe when he retired. And then there's been various other owners, uh, that's come and gone. So.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> And then, cause, so what I read was that it was around the pandemic. That, um, the ownership sort of spread from two or three people out to, to more, uh, more of the employees. Is that right? </p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Peter:</strong> Yeah, uh, I mean if you want the brutal, honest story, it's, uh, at, or whatever, 20. Yeah. Right. I came back, I had worked here.</p>
<p>Um, as bookstore manager when I was in graduate school, I have a PhD in psychology. Um, but I worked here and then I went off and tried to practice my career and found out I didn't like my career. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> Yep. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Peter:</strong> Um, and so when Mike retired... Uh, I had the opportunity to come back and become general manager of the whole business.</p>
<p>Um, doesn't mean I knew what I was doing. Had no expertise in management, no expertise in running a business, coffee shops, any of that stuff. Um, but anyways, I, I came back and took over 20, 2016 or 2017, something like that. And, um, it was okay. The ownership circle at the time was, you could argue, was composed of three people, but really it's like three couples.</p>
<p>You know, husband and wife teams. Um, One of them had been in coffee for some time, but was kind of silent. Um, And then the other two came, had bought in and came from, uh, business tech backgrounds. And, uh, those two had a very sort of modern tech oriented idea of what they thought the trident would become.</p>
<p>Um, and so there was a lot of like infighting kind of, and you know, just like they would try random things and they didn't know what they were doing. And I would, so I've kind of told them a lot of stuff that they didn't like to hear. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> But they needed to hear it, so. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Peter:</strong> Well, I guess, yeah, but just, you know. You can't do that, you're screwing the long time customers.</p>
<p>You know, you do this, we don't want the tech, you know. So anyways, um, yeah, so, uh, Right, during the pandemic starting and everything, I sort of, you know, they weren't really stepping up to the plate in terms of being owners. And like, what are you gonna do about the business? Are we gonna close? Are we gonna stay open?</p>
<p>What are you gonna do about your 20 some staff members? You know, how are you gonna handle their jobs? You know, all these things that they didn't really Step into it and I got really in their face about it because I was like you got it. You know, this you guys are rich This is these people's livelihoods, you know, yeah, you're screwing over and so So I got him so they you know Finally stepped up and came on board and then Right when that was, you know, like March and then as we were sort of like doing this soft opening thing in June, right, where they were like, oh, maybe you can put tables out on the street or something like that, you know, six feet away, all this stuff, uh, they sort of were jumping at it really fast.</p>
<p>I was asking them to go slower just because it was another big transition. Right. We had, you know, there's all these things happen. So anyways, they fired me. Oh. So I got, uh, fired. And they tried to run the place for about two weeks and totally realized they had no idea what they were doing, didn't know anything about the business, you know, didn't understand coffee, didn't understand books, didn't understand anything.</p>
<p>So they called and asked if I would come back and I said, I would only come back if you Uh, make, Trident employee owned. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> Nice. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Peter:</strong> So they thought about it for a while. Um, and sort of after a little bit of back and forth they agreed that, yeah, that they were willing to do that, you know. They weren't going to have to sell everything.</p>
<p>They didn't have to like, you know, give up a voice or anything, right? So, um, They basically agreed and they, uh, decided to sell as many shares as staff members wanted to buy. We came up with a plan of like, what's the value of the company, how much is a share. Uh, we wrote up an operating agreement, purchase agreement, all those sort of things.</p>
<p>Um, so then in June of whatever that is, 2019.</p>
<p>Twelve staff people. I think it was twelve, probably. Yeah, bought in. Bought shares and it became employee owned at that point. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> So you came up with the structure of how many shares there were? </p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Peter:</strong> Yeah, well there's a hundred shares. We kept it very, very simple. We looked at like, uh, you know, there's like various legal structures.</p>
<p>There's like a co op, there's an ESAP, there's a, there's a, all these different like legal versions that you can do to become employee owned. And they're all kind of geared for like bigger companies and you know, they get really complicated and you need lawyers and you need all, you know, we're like, well, You know, we're just a small bookstore, coffee shop.</p>
<p>So we just went simple, we just, it wrote up an operating agreement which dictates how many shares, there's a hundred shares, how much the shares are valued, uh, how you value the company, when you get to sell shares, when you get to buy shares. Like, you know, who has voting, like, voting rights, how you make decisions, all these sort of things.</p>
<p>So, yeah. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> Cool. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Peter:</strong> So it worked out, yeah, pretty straightforward. So that was in 2019, now we're up, I think now we have like, uh, 20 owners, maybe, I think. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> Okay. </p>
<p>And how, uh, how distributed would you say that ownership is? As far as like, you know, does all the 20 people each have 5 shares? Or is it more, um... </p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Peter:</strong> Yeah, it's all over the place.</p>
<p>Um... One guy who is from the former ownership group still has the... He still has 33 shares. Okay. Uh, but like I have 20... Or 20%, right? 20 shares. Uh, I think Jake has 6 shares now. A lot of people have like 1 or 2 shares. Um, yeah. Scott has... 13 shares, you know, so it's pretty, pretty well distributed, but it, uh, the way we wrote the operating agreement is it doesn't matter how many shares you have in terms of your voting rights.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> Nice. Okay. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Peter:</strong> Only you know, you get one vote as a partner, so. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> Gotcha. So if you have any number of shares, then you get one vote. Okay. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Peter:</strong> Yeah. So no one can overpower someone just by owning more. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> Right. So, okay. And then the majority stake, or like the number of shares you have is. Uh, </p>
<p>would matter, like, if the business were sold sometime in the future, you would get 20 percent of that sale, or, where else does that play in?</p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Peter:</strong> Yeah, it plays in terms of profit sharing, uh, if we make profit and we decide to pull it out as opposed to reinvest it or whatever. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> And is that decision one person, one vote, or? </p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Peter:</strong> Yeah, everything is one person, one vote. Okay, including the profit sharing. Yeah. Okay. So we call it a distribution. Um, yeah, and you get, so we all, every month we have an ownership meeting.</p>
<p>We post agenda items. And so if we're, you know, we talk about the P and L a little bit, I'm pretty much the, like myself and Scott are kind of the numbers guys I've learned to. So I do all the banking, all the HR, all the invoicing, all the, you know, payroll, everything. So I have a pretty good idea of the P&amp; Ls.</p>
<p>So, yeah, once a month we talk about the P&amp; Ls and whatever else we want to talk about. And every quarter, if we want to, we can talk about doing a distribution. Last quarter we said, no, let's give everyone a raise instead. Uh, type of thing, so. Yeah. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> Cool. Yeah. Um, yeah. No, I mean, this is, this is awesome for me as like, I don't have, like, any direct experience with, uh, these sort of structures and stuff, but it's something I'm...</p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Peter:</strong> We don't either. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> Well, it's something I'm very interested in. Clearly you guys are, are doing it. Um, </p>
<p>so I mean... </p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Peter:</strong> Yeah, I mean, I guess it's a little ironic though, you're, cause your class or your title is expertise and... It's like, I would argue none of us have expertise in what we're </p>
<p>doing. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> Yeah, well, and so what I'm arguing is that it's not any one person, even though you're just saying you have a lot of, uh, an idea about a lot of it, um, it's not any one person that makes this place run.</p>
<p>And, uh, so I mean I guess that would be a good question to ask is like, so you don't think that anybody has expertise in this, um. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Peter:</strong> Well we have expertise in our own little areas, but in terms of running a business, in terms of finances, in terms of HR, in terms of, uh, employee ownership, no. No one, none of us know what we're doing, you know, and even me as a general manager, I can still to this day.</p>
<p>I've been doing it for whatever, five, six years now. I still don't. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> You're learning something new every day. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Peter:</strong> Yeah, to some extent, yeah. Uh, and we definitely don't run it like, uh, I think most businesses are running. Uh, it's definitely not top down. There's definitely, uh, a lot of leeway, a lot of personal empowerment.</p>
<p>So, yeah, it's not your normal corporate structure here. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> Right. </p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, that's kind of exactly what I'm, like, aiming to, like, explore in this degree. Um, is when, like, there's a number of different coffee shops just down Pearl Street. Um, do you feel like this is a model that could be replicated? Is there, like, anything, um, that you guys, that you feel like you guys have learned through doing this so far, or, like?</p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Peter:</strong> Well, sure, it can be replicated, uh, but that's not the question anyone ever asks, it's do they want to replicate it. Right. And I can guarantee that no, no business owner on Earl Street, especially, Wants to take a business that they have invested a lot of capital, a lot of capital in, personal capital, probably they've put their name on credit lines, right, they've put time and effort in.</p>
<p>No one wants to all of a sudden turn over their business to their employees, even if they sell the shares, right? No one here wants to do that, so. No coffee shop owner wants to do that, is going to do that. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> But you think that this is a better model than, which, I mean, that's what I would think, that this is a better model.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Peter:</strong> Well, it's different. I think it's, I think it's better for the staff. Uh, yeah, 100 percent better for the staff. It's probably better for the business itself. Our numbers never went down during COVID. Everyone else went down, we never went down. Partly because of what we did. But again, Yeah, I mean, it's better for staff and stuff, but I still don't, you know, You know, Justin at Ozo does not want to do that at all, right?</p>
<p>He's a huge capitalist. He'll fire people before he even, like, gives them another shift or gives them a raise, right? You know? Johnny at Laughing Goat, same thing. He invested a ton of personal, he got a ton of private equity. No way would he ever give that away.</p>
<p>You know, Greg at Beleza, same thing, right? He got fired from OZO. But he had enough credit in the industry to start Beleza. There's no way he would give that to his staff. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> And so if it's better for the business and better for the staff, um, Do you see any like avenues for other... Like for this business model to proliferate, uh, </p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Peter:</strong> for sure.</p>
<p>And I think, I mean, I think it could at those coffee shops, but I think it would require, um, a lot of education, a lot of showing the current owners that, you know, I think it's just, it's like a mental thing, you know, just like what happened here. At first they said no, right? He's like, no, why would I do that?</p>
<p>And then they thought about it. You talk to him about it and it's like, well, I'm not asking you to sell your whole business to us or like, you know, go away. I'm just asking you to empower your employees and to let them have a vested interest so that they can not have a bleak future in a post COVID post dystopian, apocalyptic world, you know, right.</p>
<p>Right, they own a business, and they own a business downtown Boulder, which is insane if you're a 23 year old to say that, you know, so. And yeah, the business is doing better, but I think it would take a lot of education to get them to see that, versus them just seeing that, oh, I'm giving up my, my equity, </p>
<p>kind of thing.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> They are selling it, so it's not like they're just giving it up, </p>
<p>but they're... </p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Peter:</strong> Right. But that's how you view it, kind of. Right. Yeah. Right? Because you're not... You're also not selling it when you're ready to sell it, and you're not selling it, per se, at its peak value. Right. You know, so... There are those attributes.</p>
<p>Generally, when you sell, you devalue all your assets so you get a bigger capital gain. You're not doing that either, right? Because you're kind of claiming your assets are still good. So, it's possible. But again, it's just, I think it's one of those things that would require a lot of education on their part to get them to see that it's not a bad thing.</p>
<p>You know. Plus it also, I mean, it's twice as much work to run an employee owned business than to not, right? Because now we have to get 20 people who agree on something versus one person to just say, this is what we're doing. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> Right, right. Which is, you know, less efficient, but at the same time you don't have one person who's just firing people on a whim</p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Peter:</strong> right, right. So you empower your staff, they get... Decision making powers business runs better, but every month we Spend an hour and a half Sometimes dicking around on topics and it's just like, you know, it's very frustrating, but you just sort of deal with it, you know, so And we're getting better It's like moving through our agenda items, you know, not bringing like personal opinions or emotion to the meetings and stuff, but that's a huge learning curve, right?</p>
<p>So, you know, and most, most of the shops on Pearl Street are owned by people in their forties, fifties and sixties, you know, so I don't think they have a lot of tolerance or patience for that anymore. So. I know how to run a business. Let's just do this. And it's like, Oh, what about I want, well, I think about, I feel like, and you're just like, Oh my God.</p>
<p>Yeah. You know, so, so you have to have someone that's willing to be the leader that is willing to go through all that. Right. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> Is, um, How is that weighed in that decision making process between like, somebody who, um, like obviously everyone gets an equal vote, but in those discussions when you're having those meetings, like, how Um, is like your opinion as the manager and like having a bit more experience than if I just started here last week and I'm, you know, causing a ruckus at these meetings.</p>
<p>Like, how's that handled? </p>
<p><strong style="color:#DE4A1D">Interrupter:</strong> Hiding, hiding in plain sight. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Peter:</strong> I'm doing an interview right now. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#DE4A1D">Interrupter:</strong> I got a, I got some teeth from Jake. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Peter:</strong> Okay. Okay.</p>
<p>Um, I guess it depends on what we're talking about. Right? Some things I can be like, well, this is how this works, you know, because I know where I do the ordering. I know where things come from and stuff. But other things, you know, we talk about, should we ban this customer, you know, that there's no right or wrong.</p>
<p>It's just like, what do we want to do as a collective? group in a business, right? Or, uh, you know, things like that. So do we want to spend money on a new espresso machine? Do we want to spend, you know, whatever, right? Do we want to pull out money and do a distribution? And they asked me, well, what do you feel comfortable leaving in the bank?</p>
<p>And I'm like, well, I want this much cash, you know, so I need this much cash to run the business, soo we, okay, you know, things like that. So, yeah, so some things are kind of deferred to me, but not everything. It just depends really on what, what we're talking about. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> Totally. Um, well, uh, so I could definitely sit here just, just about all day, uh, asking questions.</p>
<p>Um, in my doing this project, and like, and then also, like, throughout my grad program, um, like, what would be helpful for you guys? How can, um, like, in this project as I'm talking to people, like, what are the sort of things that I should be asking? If you have any ideas, um, that would be helpful for you, um, </p>
<p><strong style="color:#6600CC">Peter:</strong> Do you mean asking my staff?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. Oh, I don't know. I think you can ask them whatever you want, you know. Uh, hopefully they're super honest. I don't... I think we're a pretty... We're a pretty honest, transparent group of people. So it's not like I have any needs or wants that I don't, can't ask them or have fulfilled or whatever in that sense.</p>
<p>That's good. Uh, yeah, I mean, I think you should ask whatever you want and explore whatever questions you want. I don't, you know, I don't mind sharing whatever, you know. I don't, I don't want to hide anything. It's not like it's some secret sauce. It's like, no, we're... We're an employee owned bookstore coffee shop.</p>
<p>We work our asses off. We constantly try and innovate. We constantly try and respect every single customer, no matter what their class or creed is or anything. Um, I think that's about it, you know. That's the secret sauce, really. It's just working hard and stuff. A lot of businesses get lazy. Uh, you saw that during COVID you see it now, you know, they complain, they're like, why it's like, but they're not hustling.</p>
<p>They're not trying new things. They're not doing stuff. You know, it's hard. You get burned out, you get tired, but that's what you have to do to stay, stay relevant, stay on top of things. So </p>
<p><strong style="color:#72B372">Drew:</strong> Totally. </p>
<p>Um, and then, so the other thing, uh, also like how, what would be helpful </p>
<p>is like, so my background is software engineering.</p>
<p>Uh huh. Software </p>
<p>engineering. Which, um, I'm not trying to pitch you an app or anything, obviously, but, um. From the perspective of, and this degree is media studies, so like media platforms, tech platforms, things like that. Ways that we communicate. Um, is there like, I don't know, like, is there anything that comes to mind as like a pain point?</p>
<p>Like in that decision making process, for example, </p>
<p>like, where... I don't know about, well, 90 days.</p>
<p>Oh yeah. Okay. Um, but they charge you per, per user. So it's like, well, I'm not gonna pay a hundred plus a hundred plus dollars a month. Right. Just for that. Yeah. You know, if they gave me a $40 fee, I'd pay it, but Mm-Hmm. , you know, if I'm paying eight bucks per user and I got 25 staff, then it's, you know, and we're not a tech company, so it's not like we have a lot of cash to burn.</p>
<p>Uh, right. We're pretty analog here. I try and be analog. I, I. I have never had a good experience with tech almost, like right now. We have a heat, our back heater is on a smart thermostat and I'm having it de installed because the app is broken. And it's like, so I can't turn the heater on. It's like, why the hell is it, why do we not just have a regular thermostat?</p>
<p>super frustrating. Um, but I mean the one, the one pain point, and this is not necessarily a pain point or anything, but, uh, the one thing that I would be in favor of tech for is, is, uh, not necessarily employee valuations, but ways to, to let. Employees know how they're doing, how I view that they're doing.</p>
<p>And then also for them to let them know how I'm doing, as a general manager. So, feedback? Yeah, like a kind of like a, uh, uh, Live dashboard of, you know, just what they're, you know, B plus or whatever, or, you know, and just something cause, you know, since I've never been trained as a manager, never been trained as anything, you know, I'm not very good at doing sit down employee evaluations like every three months or six months or whatever that Thing is, right?</p>
<p>You know, staff is pretty in tune to me. They know when I'm at it. Um, </p>
<p>and like, you know, why? </p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah. So that's not of an issue. But but also, you know, I'm not the best at giving the positive feedback either. And I know that so I've thought about it. I've asked, but we've never gotten anywhere like Let's just find some sort of open source Totally grading platform or something You know, you could probably modify it because there's probably nothing out, you know, just real simple clean cut But it's just like, you know where I can just post and be like, you know shows like oh you were absent you were late these three days so that if We ever do do a sit down or wherever they can be like, Oh, that's why, you know, and they can also do that for me, you know?</p>
<p>Right. Okay. So something like that, you know, super simple sort of open tech would be cool like that, you know, where it's not, they don't have to log in, log in, you know, two, two factor authentication, just like, yeah, I hate all this stuff. It's like, it's ridiculous. So, you know, it's just, But </p>
