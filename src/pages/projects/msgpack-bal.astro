    <p>
      A library for encoding and decoding according to the msgpack specification
      in the ballerina language.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://msgpack.org">MessagePack</a> is a serialization protocol.
      It defines rules for encoding json objects in binary, usually for
      transmission across a network, and <a href="https://ballerina.io"
        >Ballerina</a
      > is a cloud-native programming language optimized for integration.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was interested in writing a Ballerina service that interfaced with an
      existing protocol that required msgpack, and found no library existed for
      it yet, so I built it. Fun project!
